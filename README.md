**Future Sales Prediction using Regression Models**



**Introduction**




This repository contains the code and data for a project to predict future sales using various regression models. The project was conducted using a real-world dataset of historical sales data.

**Process**



**The following steps were taken to complete the project:**



**Data cleaning:**

The data was cleaned to remove any errors or inconsistencies. This included removing missing values, converting categorical variables to numerical variables, and scaling the data.
**Exploratory data analysis:**

Exploratory data analysis was performed to understand the relationships between the different variables in the dataset. This information was used to select the most important variables to include in the regression models.
**Model building:**


Various regression models were trained and evaluated on the dataset. The models included linear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, and random forest.
Model selection: The random forest model was selected as the best model based on its r2 score of 91.
Results

The random forest model was able to predict future sales with a high degree of accuracy. The r2 score of 91 indicates that the model explains 91% of the variation in the sales data.

**Other models**


The other regression models also performed well on the dataset. The following table shows the r2 scores for the different models:

Model	R2 score
Linear regression	89%
Ridge regression	89%
Lasso regression	89%
Random forest	91%
**Conclusion**



The random forest model is the best model for predicting future sales based on the dataset used in this project. However, the other regression models also performed well and could be used for other sales prediction tasks.

**Additional notes**



**The following are some additional notes on the project:**



The following features were used in the regression models:
TV sales
Newspaper sales
Radio Sales

The random forest model was trained using the following parameters:
n_estimators=1000,
criterion="absolute_error"
